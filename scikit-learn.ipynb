    "## Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn is a machine learning library for the Python programming language.<sup>[1]</sup> Initially developed as a Google summer of code project by David Cournapeau in 2007, scikit-learn is now one of the most popular machine learning libraries on GitHub.<sup>[2]</sup> Built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib libraries, scikit-learn is considered the gold standard for Machine Learning in the Python ecosystem.<sup>[3]</sup> Scikit-learn's key concepts and features include:<sup>[4]</sup>\n",
    "* Algorithmic decision-making methods, including:\n",
    "    * **Classification:** identifying and categorizing data based on patterns.\n",
    "    * **Regression:** predicting or projecting data values based on the average mean of existing and planned data.\n",
    "    * **Clustering:** automatic grouping of similar data into datasets.\n",
    "* Algorithms that support predictive analysis ranging from simple linear regression to neural network pattern recognition.\n",
    "* Interoperability with NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn aims to provide a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to the user.<sup>[5]</sup>\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning Algorithms** refer to algorithms which attempts to model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features.<sup>[6]</sup> Within supervised learning algorithms the input variables (*x*) and an output variable (*Y*) are know and the algorithm is employed learn the mapping function from the input to the output. The goal of supervised learning algorithmsis are to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (*x*) that you can predict the output variables (*Y*) for that data.<sup>[7]</sup> As the name suggests supervised learning algorithms incorporate the use of a \"supervisor or a teacher\". The supervisor is labeled training data which teaches the constructed algorithm to detect the underlying patterns and relationships between the input data and the output labels.<sup>[8]</sup> This algorithm is refined until it is able to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data.<sup>[9]</sup> This is concept similiar to the way a student learns in the supervision of a teacher.<sup>[10]</sup> Some of the advantages of supervised learning algorithms is that they offer the user a high degree of control of the training process and the definition of the classes<sup>[11]</sup> While some of the disadvantages are it's not seen as the most efficient option for dealing with complex tasks and can be very time intensive.<sup>[12]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning Algorithms** are a type of machine learning algorithms in which no pre-assigned labels or scores are provided to the training data.<sup>[13]</sup> As a result these algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention (hence the name unsupervised).<sup>[14]</sup> While the goal of supervised learning is to predict outcomes for new data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to get insights from large volumes of new data. The algorithm itself determines what is different or interesting from the dataset.<sup>[15]</sup> Due to its ability to discover similarities and differences in data, unsupervised learning algorithms are widely used in the fields of exploratory data analysis and image recognition.<sup>[16]</sup> Some of the advantages of unsupervised learning algorithms are that they can uncover hidden patterns which the user might not have previously considered, and the  opportunity for human error is drastically minimized.<sup>[17]</sup> While some of the disadvantages include questions over the accuracy of the results due to the lack input data to train from, and no guarantee that the obtained results will be of benefit to the user.<sup>[18]</sup>\n",
