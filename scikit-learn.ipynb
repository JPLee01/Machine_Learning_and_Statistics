    "NumPy according to it's manual is a \"Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation.\"[5] The NumPy library enhances Python through the use of powerful data structures, implementing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.[6] These data structures guarantee efficient calculations with matrices and arrays.[7] As a result, NumPy is able to help programmers in easily performing numerical computations, and is considered the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.[8] Some of the numerical computations which can be performed easily with NumPy include:[9]\n",

    "The numpy.random fuction within NumPy produces pseudorandom numbers (numbers created through the use of algorithms that use mathematical formulae or simply precalculated tables to produce sequences of numbers that appear random[10]) using combinations of a BitGenerator to create sequences and a Generator to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions.[11] A BitGenerator generates random numbers. These are typically unsigned integer words filled with sequences of either 32 or 64 random bits.[12] While a Generator transforms the sequences of random bits from the BitGenerator into sequences of numbers that follow a specific probability distribution (such as uniform, Normal or Binomial) within a specified interval.[13]\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that since NumPy version 1.17.0 the Generator can be initialized with a number of different BitGenerators.[11] The default BitGenerator within NumPy is PCG64 which is a 128-bit implementation of O’Neill’s permutation congruential generator.[14]"
