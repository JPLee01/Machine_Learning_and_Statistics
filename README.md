**Machine Learning and Statistics:** Investigation into the Scikit-learn and Scipy-Stats Python libraries.

Jupyter Notebooks have been created  to investigate the Scikit-learn and Scipy-Stats Python libraries by offeing an overview, demonstration, plots and visualisations of each of the libraries for the Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment.

**Lecturer:** Dr. Ian McLoughlin

The Project instructions can be found at [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Machine_Learning_and_Statistics/blob/main/Instructions.pdf)

## 2 Project Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Assignment Repository is the source where all the work associated with
the assignment will be stored. It contains the following files and can be
located [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Programming_for_Data_Analysis-Assignment):

  **File**    |     **Description**

## 5 Problem Statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the assessment, the student was given a set of instructions which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JPLee01/Machine_Learning_and_Statistics/blob/main/Instructions.pdf). As seen, within the instructions three distinct tasks are listed to be carried out during the assessment:
1. 
2. 
3. 

## 6 User Guide
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section will describe the steps required to download and run the files in the repository.

### 6.1 Downloading the Repository
The repository is stored at the following: https://github.com/JPLee01/Machine_Learning_and_Statistics

To download the repository, do the following:
1.  Click on the above link to open the repository
2.  Once in the repository, click on the green “clone or download” button on the right side of the screen.
3.  Select "Download ZIP". This will open a prompt allowing you to save the file to a desired location on your computer.
4.  Navigate to where  the ZIP files are located on your computer and extract the compressed (.zip) files.

### 6.2 Running the Program
Once the repository has been downloaded, you will need to ensure that you are running it in the correct environment. It should be noted that this repository has been written using Python 3.8.2 and consequently it will require a Python version of 3.7 at a minimum to run as designed. The repository also requires a number of external Python libraries [seen below](#5.3-Libaries) to execute correctly. Once the correct version of Python has been installed complete with necessary libraries and the ZIP has been downloaded and extracted the user can run the program. The running of any of the programs from the command line can be executed as follows:
1.  Open a command prompt (cmd) or equivalent on your computer.([Cmdr](https://cmder.net) is recommended for Windows computers, Mac Computers via the terminal)
2.  Navigate to the desired location through the use of the change directory (cd) command.
3. Run Jupyter Notebook by typing the following at the command prompt (do not close the command prompt window throughout):
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. A notebook server should automatically launch in your default web browser (URL should be http://localhost:8888). If this does not happen, read the command prompt output. You can copy and paste the above URL into your web browser to access Jupyter Notebook.
6. Using the menu on the left side of the page, double click on the respective the jupyter notebook file:
```
scikit-learn.ipynb
scipy-stats.ipynb
```
7. The notebook should open in a new tab. You can run each cell with the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+ENTER, alternatively use the "play" button on the menu bar. Please note that certain cells must be run before others e.g. the cells importing the various Python libraries. You may find it convenient to use the "Run all Cells" option in the "Run" dropdown menu.

### 6.3 Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in the writing of the programs code and are required to successfully run the programs:
* 
* 
*
